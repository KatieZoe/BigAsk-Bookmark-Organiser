# BigAsk - Bookmark Organiser

The aim of this project was to build a web application from the ground up using the skills we have learnt in the course so far. I chose to create a bookmark organiser because throughout the course we have been provided with many links to various websites for additional reading or practice on some of the topics and I wanted to have my personal bookmarks separated into categories so that I could quickly access the links as I need them.

I have 3 models in my web application - user, category and bookmark. I used association between all 3 of them with the user having many categories and bookmarks through categories, the categories having many bookmarks and the bookmarks belonging to a category. 

Things I want to add in next version:

* frequency tracker through JQuery to count bookmark clicks and add them to category frequency column then order by most used or top 3 etc.
